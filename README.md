I couldn't access the GitHub repository directly due to a browsing issue. However, I can **create a professional README** for your project **Speech Emotion Classification and Cross-Language Generalization** based on your earlier project details (dataset, features, application, etc.).

Here’s a draft:

# **Speech Emotion Classification and Cross-Language Generalization**

## **Overview**

This project focuses on building a robust **Speech Emotion Recognition (SER)** system capable of accurately classifying emotions across multiple languages. It leverages audio-based features such as **MFCCs, spectrograms, prosodic, and temporal features**, and employs advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques to enhance cross-lingual generalization.

The project also includes an **ablation study** to analyze performance across different languages, aiming to create a model that performs well on languages like **Hindi, Telugu, Kannada, and Urdu**.

---

## **Features**

* Speech emotion classification with high accuracy.
* Cross-language generalization testing and evaluation.
* Feature extraction using **MFCC, Chroma, Spectral Contrast, and Mel Spectrogram**.
* Implementation of **machine learning (SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost)** and **deep learning (LSTM, CNN)** models.
* Real-world application: **Personalized music recommendation system** based on detected emotions.

---

## **Datasets**

The project utilizes popular SER datasets:

* **RAVDESS**
* **TESS**
* **IEMOCAP**
* Regional language datasets (Hindi, Telugu, etc.).

## **How to Run**

1. Preprocess and extract features:

   ```bash
   python src/feature_extraction.py
   ```
2. Train models:

   ```bash
   python src/train.py
   ```
3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app/app.py
   ```

---

## **Results & Analysis**

* Achieved **cross-language accuracy improvements** through data augmentation and transfer learning.
* Detailed ablation study performed for language-specific features.

---

## **Future Scope**

* Expand to more languages.
* Integrate real-time speech input with emotion prediction.
* Develop a voice assistant that adapts responses based on detected emotions.
